# Amazon_Clone
This project is a front-end clone of the popular e-commerce website Amazon, built using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to replicate the user interface and design of Amazon's website to gain hands-on experience with web development, focusing on layout design, responsive web design, and user interface styling.
